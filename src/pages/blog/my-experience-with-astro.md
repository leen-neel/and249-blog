I first heard about [Astro](https://astro.build/) from [FireShip's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsTXcSeAZq8) last year and didn't really pay any heed to it. In my defence I was relatively new to the field and didn't care about my websites being super fast. But hey, it's about time I started caring about it and boy did Astro exceed my expectations. In the past few months I've tinkered around with it and it's been an amazing experience.

## Making an "app" with Astro

This has been somewhat of a mistake, but a great learning experience whatsoever. I tried making this todo application with Astro and I've grown to regret my decision. No matter how hard I tried I didn't get to get my JS to load. Only to realise that I've missed out the part where it talked about shipping zero JS to the browser by default. From there it's been sort of a smooth sailing. But, spending a whole day trying to figure out how to make data persist between my [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) components was not a fun task. 😅 Silly Neel at it again.

In the end I dumped everything and made the whole app in a single component instead. In my defence, I was frustrated and my body hurt from coding for 10 hours straight. 😬

## Headless WordPress integration with Astro

This has been a real treat. I've been using WordPress for around 8 years now and it's easily my most favorite CMS platform. Integrating headless WordPress with Astro to build static site's been an amazing experience.

I loved it so much that I went ahead and added a full guide on the [Astro docs.](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/cms/wordpress/) I've built a whole website with it which you can see [visit right now.](https://wc-dinos.netlify.app/)

## Making this blog

Last but not least. This site. This very site that you're in right now has been built on Astro. Picking Astro for making this blog site was a no-brainer because Astro shines in use cases like this. Building this website has been a fun experience.

I used only Astro and SCSS to make this website. No CSS frameworks added. Making the bundle size super small.
